  <p align="left">Hello and welcome to my page!  My name is Brad Perlman and I am currently a Senior at UCF.  Last year was actually<br/> my first year at UCF as I transferred from Syracuse University.
    I also switched from a Business Marketing major to a<br/> Game Design major and so far loving every second of it!  I'm from sunny south Florida, and outside of gaming with my<br/> brother
     and buddies, I love playing hockey.  I joined the club team here last year and we made it to Nationals which<br/>
      was an awesome experience.  I'm looking forward to learning more about programming and am excited for the future!</p>
